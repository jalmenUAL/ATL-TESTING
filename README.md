# ATL-TESTING
PROPERTY BASED TESTING OF ATL TRANSFORMATIONS

This tool enables testing of ATL transformations. This tool is an extension of a previously developed tool for testing XML-based languages. With this aim an Ecore to XML Schema transformation is defined which makes to automatically generate random Ecore models possible. These randomly generated Ecore models are used to test ATL transformations. Properties to be tested are specified by OCL constraints, describing input and output conditions on source and target models, respectively.
